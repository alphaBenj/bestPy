    "Now that we got to know `bestPy`'s powerful algorithms, we cant't wait to use them, right? In trying to do so, however, we might realize that they are pretty bare-bone and inconvenient to handle. For example, we need to know the internally used integer index of a customer to get a preditiction for him/her instead of just getting a prediction for the customer ID. Likewise, we only get back an array of scores for each article and still have to search for the most highly recommended, still have to translate its index into an actual article ID, _etc._\n",
