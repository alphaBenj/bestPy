    "## 4.3 Algorithms: Truncated SVD\n",
    "The second main algorithm implemented in `bestPy` is _truncated singular-value decomposition_ (SVD). Briefly, the underlying assumption of this algorithm is that there exists, in fact, a relatively small number of hidden features (or _factors_) that characterize each article. Each cutomer is, in turn, charaterized by preferences for each of these factors. We do not know what they are and neither do we need to. All we need to do is to chose how many there are of them. The number of hidden (or _latent_) factors is thus the main parameter of the algorithm. Too few and we cannot fully express the details of cutomer preferences, too many and we will end up recommending only articles that the customer has already bought.\n",
